<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In Group games, the goal is to be the player who scores the most points by the end of the game. The game will end once all rounds indicated at creation have been completed. For these games, it is necessary that each player has a device to log in with their username and respond to the questions in each round. It's also important to have a stable connection, as otherwise, actions performed between players will not sync correctly with the server.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">A round is considered finished when all connected players have answered the 3 options for Title, Artist, and Year. To be considered connected, a player must have entered the group game screen; otherwise, even if the player was invited, they will not be counted.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">To start a Round, press the Play button on the player (you can also use the spacebar on PC or double-tap on touch screens). From that moment, music will play, and all players will have 15 seconds to think before the answer options appear. Once that time has passed, 5 options will appear for each question. Both the title and the artist will only show half of their letters, with a wildcard character for the remaining letters. As players answer, the server will collect these responses and the order they were submitted. A player is considered to have answered when all 3 options have been marked, one for each question. Once an option is marked, it cannot be changed.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In a group game, there are 2 roles:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Master: The game creator who is also a player but has the responsibility to manage the game. They have tools available that other players do not. First, they can end a round at any time if needed. Additionally, initially, only the Master can activate the player to start playback and the round, though they will have an icon under the player allowing them to activate it for the other players.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Guest: All players invited to the game by the Master. To participate in the game, they must click the link that appears in the Panel under the Guest Game section.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Points are awarded based on correct answers:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15 points for getting the Title correct</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15 points for getting the Artist correct</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15 points for getting the Release Year correct</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If a player is the first to answer any of the questions correctly, they receive a bonus by doubling the points for that answer. Remember that the order of answers applies to all 3 questions: the first player to answer Title, Artist, and Year will hold first place, the next second, and so on. If the first player misses any of the answers, the bonus will pass to the next player, and so on.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">When all rounds have been completed, a screen with the results and answers given by all players will appear.</font></p>
