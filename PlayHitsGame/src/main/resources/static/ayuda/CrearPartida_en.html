<font color="#4ea72e"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="6" style="font-size: 24pt"><b>Game</b></font></font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Here, you can create a game to play. You can create a personal game to play alone or with friends, or you can create a group game to set up a party and compete with your friends.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Themes are groups of songs that share something in common. Any songs not included in a specific theme will appear under the theme "PlayHistGame."</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">The Start Year and End Year correspond to the range of years you want to use to select songs. The minimum range must be 5 years, and by default, it goes from 1950 (the earliest possible year) to the current year (the latest).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">For all types of games, note that once you select a theme and a year range, the system will search for songs available for that selection. If there aren't enough songs, an error message will appear, and you'll need to make another selection, such as widening the year range.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Also, remember that you can only have one active game at a time, whether it's personal or group, created by you. The system won't let you create a new game until the current one is finished. This does not include games you’ve been invited to.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font color="#00a933"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="5" style="font-size: 20pt"><b>Personal Game</b></font></font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">To create this type of game, in addition to selecting a theme and a year range, you’ll need to choose a difficulty level. There are four levels:</font></p>

<p align="center"><a name="__DdeLink__60_1366720253"></a><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Training</b>: This level allows you to play without ending the game until the end button is pressed, but any score will not be considered on the records table. Ideal for getting started and testing your skills.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Normal</b>: In this level, you must correctly answer at least 2 out of the 3 questions to proceed to the next round and continue the game. This level will require a good knowledge of the selected songs.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Easy</b>: At this level, you need to answer at least 1 out of the 3 questions correctly. The score will be halved compared to the Normal level. Great for beginners.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Hard</b>: Here, you can show your full potential. You cannot miss any answers, and your score will be doubled compared to the Normal level. Only for true experts.</font></p>

<p align="center"><br/>
<br/>

</p>
<p align="center"><font color="#00a933"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><font size="5" style="font-size: 20pt"><b>Group Game</b></font></font></font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In this type of game, the Group field (which can be set during registration or updated from the Modify My Data option on the panel) is used. All players with the same value in this field can join the game. The value can contain any characters, such as "Friends 2024." If no one shares your group, you can create this type of game, but you won't be able to add other players.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">If there are players with the same group as yours, a list will appear where you can include them in the game by checking/unchecking their corresponding box (they are checked by default).</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At this point, note that there are two types of players for the game: the Master, who creates and manages the game with privileges such as ending a round or enabling/disabling playback for others (by default, playback is disabled for all except the Master), and the Guests, who are the other players.</font></p>

<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Lastly, to create the game, you must specify the number of rounds to be played. When the specified number of rounds is completed, the game will end, and the final results will display each player’s answers. The default number of rounds is 10, but it can be extended to 15, 20, 25, or 30.</font></p>
