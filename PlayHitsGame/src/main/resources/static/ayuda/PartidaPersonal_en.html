Games</b></font></font></font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">In Personal games, the
goal is to get the highest number of points possible. To do this, the
first challenge is to pass as many rounds as possible (if possible,
finishing the game when no more songs are selected for it) and to
score the maximum number of points in each round.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">At the beginning of each
round, you must press the play button on the player (you can also use
the spacebar on PC or double-tap on touch screens). Once the song is
identified, select the corresponding answers for the Title, Artist,
and Release Year. Both the title and the artist will appear with only
half of their letters visible, with a wildcard character for the
remaining letters.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Only one answer can be
selected for each group, and once selected, it cannot be modified.
After providing answers to the 3 questions, the system will calculate
the points obtained, and if possible, it will proceed to the next
round.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">Points are awarded based
on correct answers:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15 points for getting
the Title correct</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15 points for getting
the Artist correct</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">15 points for getting
the Release Year correct</font></p>
<p align="center"><font color="#000000"><font face="Comic Sans MS">These
are the points if the selected difficulty for the game is Normal. If
Easy was chosen, these points are halved, and if Difficult was
chosen, they are doubled. Keep in mind that if the 'Unobfuscated'
option was selected, the points based on the level will be divided by
2. For Training difficulty, the points are the same </font></font><font face="Comic Sans MS">as
in Normal, but they do not count toward updating records for the
Topic.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">These points are reduced
by the time taken to answer, considering that there is a 15-second
countdown from when the round loads, which does not reduce points and
should be used to start the playback and listen to part of the song.
For example, a Normal round where the Artist and Year were correct,
and 13 seconds were used (after the 15-second countdown), will score
17 points.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">For each round played,
information will be added with the answers, and if you click on the
cover, you can play the song again.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS">To advance to the next
round, the chosen difficulty will be taken into account:</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Training</b>: This
level allows playing without ending the game until the button is
pressed to do so. It is only active in this type of game.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Normal</b>: In this
level, you must get at least 2 out of the 3 answers correct to move
on to the next round and continue the game.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Easy</b>: At this
level, you need to get at least 1 out of the 3 answers correct.</font></p>
<p align="center"><font face="Comic Sans MS"><b>Difficult</b>: Here
you can demonstrate your full potential, as you must not get any of
the answers wrong.</font></p>
